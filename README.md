This project involves the cleaning of an Airbnb dataset, which was later used for creating an informative and interactive Tableau dashboard. The goal was to refine and prepare the data, ensuring its suitability for visual analysis, by addressing common data quality issues such as missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
